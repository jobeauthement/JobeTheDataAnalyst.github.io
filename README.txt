Hello, This is Jobe.

Thank you for viewing my portfolio project website: https://jobeauthement.github.io/JobeTheDataAnalyst.github.io/  

I have edited a few things like centering, images, breaks.  I also edited the website links to open up into new browser windows.
This is an ongoing project for me and I am continuing to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
I am looking to further develop my web content editing skills.
I also look forward to learning more front end skills and dev environments.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio.

Sincerely,

Jobe

This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)
